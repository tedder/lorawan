# LoRaWAN
This is a LoRaWAN v1.0 implementation in python.

It uses: https://github.com/mayeranalytics/pySX127x

For reference on LoRa see: https://www.lora-alliance.org/portals/0/specs/LoRaWAN%20Specification%201R0.pdf

This fork adds support for the Adafruit LoRA Radio Bonnet with OLED - RFM95W @ 915MHZ.

It also allows you to connect as a client to the Helium Network.

You must create a device on the Helium Console at https://console.helium.com/

You need to rename "keys_example.py" to "keys.py" and enter you device information from the Helium Console.


## Installation
To register a device and get a device ID you need to run otaa_helium.py and stores the results in keys.py.

Then you can run tx_helium.py to send messages by specifying the msg and the frame like this:

    python3 tx_helium.py --msg "Test" --frame 1

You can run rssi_helium.py which utilizes the OLED screen and buttons.

This will sent a tranmission when it starts and whenever you press the middle button.

The transmission is a confirmed data message so a response will be received if a hotspot is in range.

The message just sends with the same frame to prevent having to track that and since the up link data is not needed.

The script pulls the RSSI, the packet RSSI, and the SNR and displays it on the OLED.

## TODO
Automatically track frame number. 
Automatically capture device registration info and put in keys.py.
